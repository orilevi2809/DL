        "---\n",
        "In this task, we are going to use $x \\in \\mathcal{R}^{512}$ and simple neural network that outputs $f(x) \\in \\mathcal{R}^{512}$. The network will have 100 layers with 512 units in each layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We initialize the weights from a unit normal distribution. Run the following code cell and explain what happens. Add a short piece of code that locates when it happens (hint: use `torch.isnan()`). **Print** the layer number.\n",
        "2. We can demonstrate that at a given layer, the matrix product of inputs $x$ and weight matrix $a$ that is initialized from a standard normal distribution will, on average, have a standard deviation very close to the square root of the number of input connections. For our example, with 512 dimensions, show that for 10,000 multiplications of $a$ and $x$, the empirical standard deviation is similar to the square root of the number of input connections. Use the unbiased version: $$ \\hat{std} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{10000}\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N y^2}{10000}}, $$ where $y=ax$ and $N$ is the number of input connections. **Print** the mean, std and the square root of the number of input connections.\n",
        "3. For the code from 1, normalize the weight initialization by the square root of the input connections. How does that change the outcome? **Print** the mean and std after the modification.\n",
        "4. Add a `tanh()` activation after each layer for the code from 1. **Print** the mean and std after the modification. Explain the result.\n",
        "5. Xavier initialization sets a layer’s weights to values chosen from a random uniform distribution that’s bounded between $$\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{n_i + n_{i+1}}}$$ where $n_i$ is the number of incoming network connections, or “fan-in,” to the layer, and $ n_{i+1}$ is the number of outgoing network connections from that layer, also known as the “fan-out”. Glorot and Bengio believed that Xavier weight initialization would maintain the variance of activations and back-propagated gradients all the way up or down the layers of a network and demonstrated that networks initialized with Xavier achieved substantially quicker convergence and higher accuracy. Implement **Xavier Uniform** as `xavier_init(fan_in, fan_out)`, a function that returns a tensor initialized according to **Xavier Uniform**. Use it on the simple network from 1 with `tanh` activation. **Print** the mean and std after the modification.\n",
        "6. If you try to replace the `tanh` activation with `relu` activation in section 5, you will see very different results. Xavier strives to acheive activation outputs of each layer to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation around 1, on average. When using a ReLU activation, a single layer will, on average have standard deviation that’s very close to the square root of the number of input connections, **divided by the square root of two** ($\\sqrt{\\frac{512}{2}}$ in our example). **Kaiming He et. al.** proposed an initialization scheme that’s tailored for deep neural nets that use these kinds of asymmetric, non-linear activations. Implement **Kaiming Normal** as `kaiming_init(fan_in, fan_out)`, a function that returns a tensor initialized according to **Kaiming Normal** (use `fan_in` mode). Use it on the simple network from 1 with `relu` activation. **Print** the mean and std after the modification. What happens when you use Xavier with RelU activation?"

        "When using Xavier initialization with ReLU activation, the network may suffer from the \"dying ReLU\" problem, where many ReLU units become inactive and output 0 for any input, which can lead to poor performance. This is because Xavier initialization assumes that the activation outputs of each layer have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation around 1, which is not the case for ReLU activation. The Kaiming initialization scheme addresses this problem by scaling the standard deviation of the weights by $\\sqrt{2}$, which matches the standard deviation of the activation outputs when using ReLU activation."
